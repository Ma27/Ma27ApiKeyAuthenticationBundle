8) Overriding services
----------------------

It is possible to override the services, too.

The overridable services are:

- auth_handler (Ma27\ApiKeyAuthenticationBundle\Service\Auth\ApiKeyAuthenticationHandler)
- key_factory (Ma27\ApiKeyAuthenticationBundle\Service\Key\KeyFactory)

There's a service section in the bundle config that can be used in order to exchange these services.
